Summary: In this tutorial, I will be going the process of making an object class. While the syntax will not be all the same, the 
         theory and context behind the coding will be the same throughout most object oriented programming

Target Audience: This is for beginning coders who have started out coding in C# or JAVA, who are just in the phase of learning coding. I hope
                 this code is useful for other upcoming students, who people in general who are beginning to code in C# or Java
