# How to create an object in C#, by Vincent Chu

Summary: In this tutorial, I will be going the process of making an object class. While the syntax will not be all the same, the 
         theory and context behind the coding will be the same throughout most object oriented programming

Target Audience: This is for beginning coders who have started out coding in C# or JAVA, who are just in the phase of learning coding. I hope
                 this code is useful for other upcoming students, who people in general who are beginning to code in C# or Java


### Step One: 
         The goal in this tutorial will to create an person object, and give this person characteristics. Like a name, height, gender. 
         Step 1A: We need to create a class called Person. We can call this class anything we want, but ideally, it should relate to what we are making.
                  - The class will be a blueprint to creating our person object. 
                  
### Step 2A: We need to declare fields. These are variables that are UNIQUE to the object and to the class. This will include name, height, and                         gender. All being of type string

```
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        //This is the main program where all programs start in C#
    }
}

//A different class that is specific to making the person object. 

public class Person
{
  
    {
        accountNumber = AccountNumber;
        pin = Pin;
        firstName = FirstName;
        lastName = LastName;
        balance = Balance;
        numDeposits = NumDeposits;
        numWithdrawals = NumWithdrawals;
        accountType = AccountType;
    }

```
